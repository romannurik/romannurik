**Hi, I’m Roman.** I’m a design manager on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) at Google in New York, but I also tinker with web dev. I've also done and Android stuff like [Muzei](https://github.com/romannurik/muzei). You can see some of my older work in my old [portfolio](https://roman.nurik.net/portfolio).
