**Hi, I’m Roman.** I’m a design manager on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) at Google in New York, but I also tinker with web dev and Sketch/Figma plugins. I've also done Android stuff like [Muzei](https://github.com/romannurik/muzei). See more of my work on my [personal site](https://roman.nurik.net/projects).
